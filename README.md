### Compiling

I'm not sure how hard this will be to compile on your systems, but here's how I think you should try:

1. Install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. Install [LLVM 4](https://llvm.org/)
  * Method 1: Install directly using your package manager
  * Method 2: Install [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)

     Install Nix with your package manager or from the site, then when you use a stack command like `stack build` or `stack exec`, instead use `stack build --nix` or `stack exec --nix`
3. In this directory, run:

   ```
   stack --install-ghc
   stack build
   stack exec -- plt
   ```
